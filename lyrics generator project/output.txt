 This night is cold in the kingdom I can feel you fade away from the kitchen to the bathroom sink in Your steps keep me awake
 don't cut me down
 throw me out
 leave me in a waste
 I once was a man with dignity and grace Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold and embrace
 so please
 please Could you find a way to let me down slowly? A little sympathy
 I hope you can show me If you wanna go then I'd be so lonely If you leave me in a baby let me down slowly If you wanna go then I'd be so lonely If you leave me in a baby let me down slowly Cold skin drag my feet on the tile As I'm walking down the corridor and I know we haven't talked in a while So I'm looking for an open door
 don't cut me down
 throw me out
 leave me in a waste
 I once was a man with dignity and grace Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold and embrace
 so please
 please Could you find a way to let me down slowly? A little sympathy
 I hope you can show me If you wanna go then I'd be so lonely If you leave me in a baby let me down slowly If you wanna go then I'd be so lonely If you leave me in a baby let me down slowly And I can't stop myself from falling And I can't stop myself from falling And I can't stop myself from falling Don't come and I can't stop myself from falling Don't come and I can't stop myself from falling Could you find a way to let me down slowly? A little sympathy
 I hope you can show me If you wanna go
 then I'll be so lonely If you leave me
 baby
 let me down slowly If you wanna go
 then I'll be so lonely If you wanna go
 then I'll be so lonely
